# C-Sharp Lambda_Production ready template

## Description:
I created a production-ready aws lambda template, using C#.
THERE ARE NO ACCURATE DOCS OF HOW TO DO THIS - AT ALL!!!!
This thing might as well be pure gold.

## Usage:
1) Clone and change whatever you need to, then build. 
2) Create a new aws lambda and upload the code .zip to it
3) Create an API Gateway that will call this lambda, and test
4) Realize that it works perfectly

## Why this is awesome:
It allows us to host APIs in lambdas - using C#.
the use case for this is to simply use the console app to build up your api functionality, then host the app in the lambda.
There are no accurate docs of how to host a C# REST API in a lambda, so this is invaluable to us
